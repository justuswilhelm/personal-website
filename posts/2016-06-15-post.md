Uber Rush provides cost-effective on-demand courier services. It is an exciting
service that will allow companies to start delivering to local customers
faster. Uber tries to make the process as easy as possible by providing an API
which can be easily integrated into existing shop solutions and lets customers
order cheap and easy shipping. <!--more--> For a high-level overview, please
refer to [this document](https://rush.uber.com/how-it-works/).

We are going to look at the
[UberRUSH API](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush) from a technical
perspective and try coming up with common usage scenarios that an application
developer will encounter when working with this API. This article is going to
be useful if you plan on integrating UberRUSH into your application. Instead of
working with the real API, we will make use of Uber's API sandbox.

We want to perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the Uber API. We want to retrieve a valid OAuth2 token.
2. Request delivery quotes. Customers need to see a delivery quote before
   choosing UberRUSH delivery.
3. Schedule a delivery. In order to start the delivery process, the delivery
   endpoint will be called.
4. Retrieve delivery details. Present the customer with shipping information
   and forward the shipping info to shipping/warehouse.
5. Cancel the delivery. Our customer regrets their purchase. We are in a
   sandbox. Let's complete the cycle and cancel the delivery.

# Signing up for Uber's API

No API that is worth its two cents can be used without a good old API key pair.
First we head over to the UberRUSH [account
management](http://t.uber.com/newrushapp) page. Then, we are ready to register
our application and create a key pair. Head over to the [Developer
Dashboard](https://developer.uber.com/dashboard) and you'll be done in no time.

# API Wrapping with Tortilla + Python

Now, I would like to introduce a tasty, delicious Python-based API tool called
[Tortilla](https://github.com/redodo/tortilla). It will make any inedible API
digestible (as long as it does json). Similar to how SQLAlchemy or the Ruby on
Rails ORM are designed you can compose queries in a compact way. For example,
given a Tortilla wrapped API `taco`, POSTing a JSON object to an endpoint
called

```
/user/1/account
```

is as easy as doing the following

```python
taco.user(1).account.post(data=dict()).
```

# Access Token retrieval

For authentication, we are going to follow the [OAuth2
guide](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/authentication) in UberRUSH's API
documentation.

Before getting started, let me vent about the quality of the API. Uber requires
developers to always use OAuth2 tokens. Entirely reasonable for a professional
application, you might say. What is not reasonable, is this:

# How to make the Uber API crash and burn

It should not be possible to make an API endpoint return `500`. But it is. Take
a look for yourself:

```shell
curl 'https://login.uber.com/oauth2/v2/token' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '1' -v 2>/dev/null
```

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>
<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your
request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the
application.</p>
```

Woops! It was an accident, I swear!

# How to actually log in

At this point I am tired of trying to figure out why the Uber API works with
curl, but not with form-encoded requests in Tortilla. Human patience only gets
you so far. That's why I am calling curl as a subprocess here. The response
will be stored as a dictionary in `token`. Furthermore, I am going to assume
that the API key pair is stored in the environment.

```python
from os import getenv
from subprocess import check_output
from json import loads
token = loads(check_output((
    'curl',
    '-F', 'client_secret=' + getenv('RUSH_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    '-F', 'client_id=' + getenv('RUSH_CLIENT_ID'),
    '-F', 'grant_type=client_credentials',
    '-F', 'scope=delivery',
    'https://login.uber.com/oauth/v2/token')).decode())
print(token.keys())
# TODO understand why any sane API provider would want a
# 1 month expiration time 2016-06-14
print("Token expires in {} days".format(token['expires_in'] / 3600 / 24))
```

```
dict_keys(['access_token', 'scope', 'last_authenticated', 'token_type',
           'expires_in'])
Token expires in 30.0 days
```

That means we have completed **step 1**.

# Retrieving a delivery quote

Now that we have a valid token, let's wrap the Uber API sandbox with Tortilla
and get started making some API calls. Tortilla takes a URL endpoint and an
arbitrary amount of headers. While it is not well documented, I appreciate the
fact that headers can be preset for all requests to follow. In this instance
we set up an `Authorization` header using the access token we have retrieved
in the last step.

```python
from tortilla import wrap
uber = wrap("https://sandbox-api.uber.com/v1",
            headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'
                     .format(token['access_token'])})
```

Tortilla does some mighty crazy `__getattr__` magic in the background. You will
now see how this can be useful.

Let's pretend for a second that Google Guy™️ has just ordered the new iPhone 8
and selected UberRUSH for delivery. In order to present a shipping quote, we
need both the pickup and drop off address. Pickup will be known to us since we
are the vendor. Obviously, it is going to be shipped right from our Apple
headquarters to the Googleplex in Mountainview, California. I've taken the
liberty of jotting down both addresses for you:

```python
pickup = {'location': {'address': '1 Infinite Loop',
                       'city': 'Cupertino',
                       'state': 'CA',
                       'postal_code': '95014',
                       'country': 'US'}}
dropoff = {'location': {'address': '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway',
                       'city': 'Mountainview',
                       'state': 'CA',
                       'postal_code': '94043',
                       'country': 'US'}}
```

According to the
[API documentation](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/post-v1-deliveries-quote),
we need to POST the two addresses to the following endpoint:

```
/v1/deliveries/quote
```

Now we can inform our Google employee on what shipping with UberRUSH is going
to cost.

```python
response = uber.deliveries.quote.post(data={'pickup': pickup,
                                            'dropoff': dropoff})
print("The delivery fee will be: {} USD".format(response.quotes[0].fee))
```

```
The delivery fee will be: 5.0 USD
```

For completeness' sake, here is the full response.

```python
{'quotes': [{'currency_code': 'USD',
   'dropoff_eta': 13,
   'end_time': None,
   'estimated_at': 1465973935,
   'expires_at': 1465975735,
   'fee': 5.0,
   'pickup_eta': 8,
   'quote_id': 'db9434b3-51b7-4a91-ae4b-6d19a4d41ccc',
   'ready_by_time': None,
   'start_time': None},
  {…},
  {…},
  {…}]}
```

Uber is giving us four different quotes, all for 5 USD but with different pick
up times. I have taken the liberty of abbreviating the three last quotes.

Let's choose the first `quote_id` in the list and schedule it. We will find out
how to do it in the next section.

```python
quote_id = response.quotes[0].quote_id
print('quote_id: {}'.format(quote_id))
```

```
quote_id: db9434b3-51b7-4a91-ae4b-6d19a4d41ccc
```

For now, we have completed **step 2**.

# Scheduling a Delivery

We need to specify the item to be delivered, using the [`/deliveries/`
endpoint](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/post-v1-deliveries). In this
case we will tell them that we're shipping an iPhone, as we promised to deliver
to Google Guy™️.

```python
items = [{'title': 'iPhone 8',
          'quantity': 1,
          'width': 2.64,
          'length': 5.44,
          'height': 0.27,
          'price': 549.0,
          'currency_code': 'USD'}]
```

# Seriously, Uber?

Those Uber barbarians use inches in their POST parameter docs. The banality of
API design.

Furthermore, letting me specify the price as a float is a crude mistake. No way
you should trust IEEE floating point decimals to your billing logic. This
sounds like something right out of Coding Horror. Actually, there is something
on Coding Horror
[about this](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-do-computers-suck-at-math/).

Less rambling. More API calling.

```python
delivery_pickup = {
    'contact': {'first_name': 'Tim',
                'last_name': 'Doe',
                'email': 'tim.doe@apple.com',
                'phone': {'number': '+1 (408) 996–1010',
                          'sms_enabled': False}},
                **pickup}  # Python 3.5 dict unpacking, see PEP 448
delivery_dropoff = {
    'contact': {'first_name': 'Larry',
                'last_name': 'Doe',
                'email': 'larry.doe@google.com',
                'phone': {'number': '+1 (650) 253-0000',
                          'sms_enabled': False}},
                **dropoff}
response = uber.deliveries.post(
    data={'quote_id': quote_id,
          'items': items,
          'pickup': delivery_pickup,
          'dropoff': delivery_dropoff})
```

Our delivery was successfully scheduled and we receive the following answer.

```python
{'courier': None,
 'created_at': 1465973936,
 'currency_code': 'USD',
 'delivery_id': 'bd108436-404c-4264-95fe-e46bdebd27be',
 'dropoff': {…},
 'fee': 5.0,
 'items': [{'currency_code': 'USD',
   'height': 0.27,
   'is_fragile': False,
   'length': 5.44,
   'price': 549.0,
   'quantity': 1,
   'title': 'iPhone 8',
   'weight': 0.0,
   'width': 2.64}],
 'order_reference_id': '',
 'pickup': {…},
 'quote_id': 'db9434b3-51b7-4a91-ae4b-6d19a4d41ccc',
 'status': 'processing',
 'tracking_url': 'https://api.uber.com/v1/sandbox/map'}

```

Again, I've shortened a few attributes as we've just specified these above. We
have succesfully scheduled a delivery. **Step 3** is complete.

# What did we just schedule?

Is a UberRUSH courier going to come to Apple's offices now? I think I'm going
to be in trouble. Let's double check and see whether my request has been
entered into Uber's system. We will use the
[`/deliveries` endpoint](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/get-v1-deliveries)
.

```python
response = uber.deliveries.get()
response.deliveries[0]
```

```python
{'courier': None,
 'created_at': 1465973936,
 'currency_code': 'USD',
 'delivery_id': 'bd108436-404c-4264-95fe-e46bdebd27be',
 'dropoff': {…},
 'fee': 5.0,
 'items': [{'currency_code': 'USD',
   'height': 0.27,
   'is_fragile': False,
   'length': 5.44,
   'price': 549.0,
   'quantity': 1,
   'title': 'iPhone 8',
   'weight': 0.0,
   'width': 2.64}],
 'order_reference_id': '',
 'pickup': {…},
 'quote_id': 'db9434b3-51b7-4a91-ae4b-6d19a4d41ccc',
 'status': 'processing',
 'tracking_url': 'https://api.uber.com/v1/sandbox/map'}
```

Again, abbreviations were made for the sake of brevity.

# Delivery detail view

Looks good. Let's get a more detailed view on this delivery using the
[`/deliveries/{delivery_id}`
endpoint](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/get-v1-deliveries-delivery_id)

```python
delivery_id = response.deliveries[0].delivery_id
print('delivery_id: {}'.format(delivery_id))
response = uber.deliveries(delivery_id).get()
print('Delivery  status: {}'.format(response.status))
```

```
delivery_id: bd108436-404c-4264-95fe-e46bdebd27be
Delivery  status: processing
```

The order has a status of `processing`. According to the [API
docs](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/statuses), this means that a courier
is about to be dispatched. **Step 4** is complete.

# Cancelling deliveries

No time to waste; we shall cancel this sandbox delivery using the
[`deliveries/{delivery_id}/cancel`
endpoint](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/post-v1-deliveries-delivery_id-cancel).

Since we are thorough beings, we are going to make sure all deliveries are
cancelled, just in case any previous deliveries are left. You will see more
than one delivery here as this is not the first session I am spending with the
UberRUSH API.

```python
from operator import itemgetter

deliveries = uber.deliveries.get().deliveries
delivery_ids = map(itemgetter('delivery_id'), deliveries)
for delivery_id in delivery_ids:
    print('Cancelling delivery_id: {}'.format(delivery_id))
    response = uber.deliveries(delivery_id).cancel.post()
```

```
Cancelling delivery_id: bd108436-404c-4264-95fe-e46bdebd27be
Cancelling delivery_id: bd50916a-f16c-4dc8-819d-aa1cfc0afa8d

Cancelling delivery_id: af1a4e0e-34db-4919-940e-4f0d147ae941
```

This is where it gets a little interesting. Instead of deleting the delivery,
UberRUSH will just mark it as `client_canceled`. We can verify this using the
[`/deliveries/{delivery_id}`
endpoint](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rush/api/get-v1-deliveries-delivery_id)
once again:

```python
print(uber.deliveries(delivery_id).get().status)
```

```
client_canceled
```

Good. Google will not get their iPhone 8 anymore and **step 5** is complete.

We've now gone through the whole UberRUSH cycle in one sitting! What's the
verdict?

# Summary

It is exciting to think about the potential uses for this easy-to-use API.
Ordering flowers and having them instantly shipped to your apartment while
cutting out all the messy delivery middleware? Having hipster bike couriers
bring artisanal craft beer? All this is going to be possible with UberRUSH!
Farewell, Spoonrocket!👻
