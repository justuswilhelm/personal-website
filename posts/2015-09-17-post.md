title: Using Async Functions in Python 3.5

With the new [async syntax](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/) in
Python 3.5, defining asynchronous functions has become a lot simpler. In this
article, I will demonstrate a simple example for this new feature.

<!--more--> It will involve pulling a set of homepages of popular websites and

displaying the first 10 characters of every HTTP response. The example will
utilize the awesome [aiohttp](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
library. Make sure that your machine has aiohttp and Python 3.5 installed.

# A Traditional, Synchronous Approach

First, let's take a look at how this would have been solved in a naive,
synchronous fashion. Let's define our set of URLs that we want to retrieve.

```python
sites = [
    'https://www.google.com',
    'https://www.yahoo.com',
    'https://www.bbc.co.uk',
    'https://en.wikipedia.org',
    'https://de.wikipedia.org',
    'https://news.ycombinator.com',
    'https://www.tagesschau.de',
]
FORMAT_STRING ="{site.url:<30.30}: {site.text:.10} in {site.elapsed}s"
```

We also need some logic to retrieve the pages.

```python
from requests import get

def get_site_snippet(site):
    return FORMAT_STRING.format(site=get(site))

def main():
    for site in sites:
        print(get_site_snippet(site))

main()
```

Once we run our example, we will see the following response

```
https://www.google.com/       : <!doctype  in 0:00:00.798940s
https://www.yahoo.com/        : <?xml vers in 0:00:00.883083s
http://www.bbc.co.uk/         : <!DOCTYPE  in 0:00:01.479646s
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/: <!DOCTYPE  in 0:00:00.172367s
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/: <!DOCTYPE  in 0:00:00.166793s
https://news.ycombinator.com/ : <html op=" in 0:00:01.464526s
https://www.tagesschau.de/    : <!DOCTYPE  in 0:00:00.991291s
```

So far so good. But knowing how this kind of code works, we quickly realize
that a lot of time is being spent waiting for and being blocked by external
resources. Usually, HTTP servers take their time to respond, and depending on a
multitude of factors, results are almost always not being delivered instantly.

Since one HTTP request has to be finished in order to execute the next HTTP
request, our program will lose a considerable amount of time being blocked by
an external resource. This is also known as an
[I/O bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_bound) computation.

By interleaving the execution of several function calls at once, we will be
able to save a considerable amount of time. In our example, this would mean
that while one function call is busy retrieving HTTP results, another function
call can already get the next site name and initiate the next HTTP request.

# Async All The Things

We are going to execute the same task, but with a twist. Instead of
synchronously executing the `get_site_snippet` function, we are going to
asynchronously get all website results and join the results in the end. Let's
take a look at how to achieve that.

```python
from asyncio.client import get

async def async_get_site_snippet(site):
    response = await get(site)
    content = await response.read()
    return FORMAT_STRING.format(site=content)
```

A keen observer will immediately notice the usage of `async` and `await`. I
won't try to get too much into the details of how these are being handled in
CPython internally. Let's just say that this means that the functions we're
calling will not return the desired result immediately. Instead, calling an
`async` function, will return a promise to eventually calculate a result. To be
more precise, calling `async_get_site_snippet('http://www.google.com')` will
return a coroutine object. The same applies for the two `await` calls, as
`get(site)` returns a promise, as well as `response.read()`.

Now, by itself the coroutine object will not do anything. Getting to the result
of every coroutine call involves some extra functionality that we are going to
add now.

First, a list of tasks needed to be created, containing all the coroutine
objects that need to be run.

```python
from asyncio import get_event_loop, wait

def async_main():
    tasks = [async_get_site_snippet(site) for site in sites]
```

Then, we create a
[BaseEventLoop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#base-event-loop)
object, that runs all our tasks until they all have completed. In order to
execute all coroutines concurrently, the list of tasks needs to be wrapped with
`asyncio.wait`. The `BaseEventLoop` object can then run the wrapped tasks until
all results are returned.

```python
    loop = get_event_loop()
    # We can safely discard pending futures
    result, _ = loop.run_until_complete(wait(tasks))
    loop.close()
```

The results of `loop.run_until_complete` are now contained in a list and are ready to be retrieved.

```python
    for task in result:
        print(task.result())

async_main()
```

Pretty neat!

The benefits immediately become apparent when we compare execution times:

```python
print("Running synchronous example")
start = time()
main()
duration = time() - start

print("Running asynchronous example")
async_start = time()
async_main()
async_duration = time() - async_start

print("Synchronous example took {} seconds".format(duration))
print("Asynchronous example took {} seconds".format(async_duration))
```

This outputs the following on my trusty laptop:

```

Asynchronous example took 6.950876951217651 seconds
```

While the result will vary slightly depending on the network and server load it
becomes clear that we can shave off a few seconds of execution time by not
letting HTTP requests block us. In this run the execution time was halved!
