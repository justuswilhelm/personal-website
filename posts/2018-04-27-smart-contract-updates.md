cta: Talk to us to learn more about safely updating smart contracts

As time goes on, smart contract requirements change. Often, a feature is added
or a bug is found. But, once a smart contract has been deployed on the
blockchain, it can't be upgraded. The entire value proposition of a blockchain
is immutability. Yet, in the real world, contracts change all the time. For
example, a labor contract will change when new labor laws are introduced.
Similarly, there are many circumstances under which smart contracts change as
well, such as

- smart contract features being added or removed,
- efficient implementations being found that lower transaction costs, and
- implementation bugs being fixed.

A contract itself cannot be replaced while still keeping the same contract
address on the blockchain. Several methods exist that all use some kind of
indirection that allow smart contracts to be replaced with newer versions and
still use the same address.

# 1. Contract Relay

A contract relay forwards all incoming calls to a designated address
using the `DELEGATECALL` opcode.

An example implementation can be seen [in this StackExchange
post](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/190).

The main idea is to define a fallback function that forwards all function
calls.

```
contract Relay {
    address contract;

    // ...

    function update(address _newContract) {
        contract = _newContract;
    }

    //...

    function(){
        if(!contract.delegatecall(msg.data)) throw;
    }
}
```

`contract.delegatecall(msg.data)` will forward all transaction data, including
`msg.sender`. For the receiver of the delegate call, the incoming call looks
like it was placed by the user themselves.

The above mentioned post also links to a [fuller
implementation](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/4ca9da48d51e23e5cfe0f0e14dd6318f)
on GitHub. It addresses the problem of how to handle the contract's internal
state when upgrading to a new version. Simply pointing the `contract` address
variable to a new contract will mean that the old contract's data will not be
copied over.

# 2. Contract Registry

The other approach to updating contracts is to break up contracts into smaller
pieces that can be exchanged easily. For this, each part needs to implement a
specific interface. If newer versions of the contract stick to the same
interface, the caller does not have to worry about internal changes of the
contract and can have static guarantees about the external behavior of this
contract.

```
interface ContractInterface {
    // ... define your contract's interface here
}
```

Then, we create the contract that we will eventually upgrade.

```
contract Contract implements ContractInterface {
    // ... first implementation of the contract
}
```

The Registry contract will contain all the small contract parts that can be
updated. Here, we allow the OpenZeppelin
[owner](https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/ownership_Ownable.html) of the
Registry to set the new version.

```
// ... import Ownable.sol

contract Registry is Ownable {
    ContractInterface public contract;


    // In this case, only the contract owner can upgrade the contract
    setContract(ContractInterface _contract) ownerOnly{
        contract = _contract;
    }
}
```

Then, in web3 we can add the contract to the registry.

```javascript
// ... deploy the new contract
// ... find out the contract address and add it to the registry
await registry.methods.setContract(contractAddress).send();
// ... now we will get the contract address to use it
contractAddress = await registry.methods.contract();
```

Let's say that after a while you create a new contract and what the registry to
point to it. First, the contract is defined using exactly the same interface as
before.

```
contract NewContract implements ContractInterface {
    // ... new implementation
}
```

As soon as the contract is deployed, we — the owner of the Registry — can now
point to the new contract by calling the `.setContract()` method with the
new contract's address.

```javascript
// ... deploy the new contract
// ... find out the contract address
registry.methods.setContract(newContractAddress).send();
```
