## Statement

Let me show you how I __can help your business become more profitable__.

The hard-to-swallow truth is that any technology you invest in will become
_outdated and inefficient_ in the next __X__ years. Your initial promise to the
investors that you will truly disrupt the world by using the latest artisanal
hipster tech stacks will grow meaningless as time passes.

I will help you get up to speed with real-world demands, such as providing
__shareholder value__ and getting from __revenue to profit__. In the end, if
you are not in it to find a sustainable, repeatable business model, _why
bother_?

The real-world challenges you will inevitably face are going to involve massive
heaps of data that will make no sense. There will be unwieldy monoliths and
microservices that keep breaking and cause you to churn users like a leaky
bucket. Your marketing strategy sounds good in theory, but you don't know how
to translate it into automated actions.

Using time-tested tools that help my clients lower infrastructure costs by
__50%__ or using 30 year old UNIX tools in order to increase your data pipeline
speed by __8x__ will help you further your business goals. Your customer does
not care how you __get the job done__. _On the internet, nobody knows you are
agile._

Never have tools mattered less than now. This is the time where individuals
with the skill to adapt to any business challenge life throws at you thrive.

There are two knobs in your business. __Revenue and Cost__. Those that know how
to turn both in the right direction will create sustainable profit.

In order to find out how I can help you reach your goals, feel free to get in
touch with me and I will take care of you personally.
