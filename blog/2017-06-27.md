I'm basing this off this
[chiebukuro post](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1435775334).

Let's look at how the three words are different.

## 大事 and 大切

Yep, both have the same meaning. Both mean

> 大事なアルバム

> This album is important (to me)

## 重要

This adjective serves to identify concepts as important in a context that
transcends one's own preference and identity.

> 重要なアルバム

> This album is important (in the history of music)

## Conclusion
大事 and 大切 come very close to the English word _important_. 重要 is about
expressing importance in the context of something larger.
